# Water

Silt regulates water temperature, controls the river’s course, and stains it red.

Diné oral traditions say that the male San Juan River once mounted the female Colorado and gave birth to cloud and rain people. The confluence is a place used for rain-requesting ceremonies, and also serves as a natural barrier of protection and territory. (Dikcey 19) Shonto singer Ernest Nelson says that the San Juan River was "laid down in the north so that people other than the Navajo would be prevented from wandering about in this sacred area" (Lukcert 117).

The reservoirt can hold twenty-seven million acre-feet, but eight hundred sixty-eight thousand have been lost ot sedimentation. (35). 

Verticality: Indigenous people are not allowed to create concessions below 3,720 feet. As the water drops, the water is far below this line, and the land goes back to the federal government although this is not what is the original agreement. Lake Powell is the only place where a boundary is an elevation, not the river. (200-201)

## Seeps

{% include feature/image-gallery.html objectid="sediment1" caption=false%}

Seeps are places where water pushes out from a cliff face. As rain falls on sandstone ground, it percolates down through the porous rock until it reaches a layer of shale, whose sedimentary particulates are gathered too tightly to allow water to pass. The water then moves sideways along the shale surface until it pushes out through the cliff wall. Water can spend years traveling through the rock before it emerges from a seep.
