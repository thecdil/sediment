# Water

## Field Notes

Water goes down 3 inches per day. That's not geologic time. People feel that in their bodies, when they have to haul the docks further out into the lake. 

The water used to come up right beneath my hotel room, now you have to walk down to it. There are chains coiled on the ground.

The hotel has tried to cover some of this--the front yard is landscaped as if it was always that way. But the further you go, the more evident the ruin becomes. The pavement drops off, the trees turn black, russian thistle huddles angrily, and then the sand becomes wet. 

There are conserve water signs everywhere. There is a tag hanging in bathroom telling me to turn off my water between shampoo and conditioner, yet they are building a data center down the road. 

Time, too feels disoriented and contingent. I booked for 2026. The water was too low to go out, and so the system sent me to next year. The woman at the front desk said that they wouldn't be able to go next year either. 

Watching the water levels unites people across viewpoints; even Powellheadz is watching the snowpack upstream, he understands it is a system. And yet, the bartender tells me that the lake won't empty, it's plenty deep at the same time as he tells me you can walk out to lone rock because it's so low, and shows me pictures of where the lake used to come right up to the lip of the pool. So I don't know what this is; maybe mere survival. These are people's livelihoods. But also, the lake goes up and down 50 feet every year. When you live in a landscape so volatile, I understand why they think this is just a cycle. 

Water is in charge of time and space; where we can go, how long it takes to get from one place to another. 

I am told that Antelope Canyon tours keep the economy afloat; yet it is filling up with sand. Our tour guide, Lynette, has everyone take pictures, and she shows us one she took a long time ago of a rock she calls George Washington about 6 feet lower to the ground. Here, everyone is producing a kind of archive. 




The town is acutely aware of the water levels


Silt regulates water temperature, controls the river’s course, and stains it red.

Diné oral traditions say that the male San Juan River once mounted the female Colorado and gave birth to cloud and rain people. The confluence is a place used for rain-requesting ceremonies, and also serves as a natural barrier of protection and territory. (Dikcey 19) Shonto singer Ernest Nelson says that the San Juan River was "laid down in the north so that people other than the Navajo would be prevented from wandering about in this sacred area" (Lukcert 117).

The reservoirt can hold twenty-seven million acre-feet, but eight hundred sixty-eight thousand have been lost ot sedimentation. (35). 

Verticality: Indigenous people are not allowed to create concessions below 3,720 feet. As the water drops, the water is far below this line, and the land goes back to the federal government although this is not what is the original agreement. Lake Powell is the only place where a boundary is an elevation, not the river. (200-201)

## Seeps

{% include feature/image-gallery.html objectid="sediment1" caption=false%}

Seeps are places where water pushes out from a cliff face. As rain falls on sandstone ground, it percolates down through the porous rock until it reaches a layer of shale, whose sedimentary particulates are gathered too tightly to allow water to pass. The water then moves sideways along the shale surface until it pushes out through the cliff wall. Water can spend years traveling through the rock before it emerges from a seep.
