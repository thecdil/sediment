# Microbes

{% include feature/image-gallery.html objectid="sediment159" caption=false%}

Glen Canyon's sediment has sustained microbial life for millions of years. Microbes metabolize sediment, water, and sunlight to eat potholes in the earth, paint “desert varnish” over the canyon walls, and build domed structures called stromatolites. Today, toxic cyanobacteria festers in Lake Powell's stagnant waters and deep silt pits.

## Varnish

The vertical stripes on this canyon wall are called 'desert varnish.' The varnish is composed by a thin gloss of sediment, minerals, and microbes interacting with one another over long periods of time, and are encouraged by water seeps, which might account for the striping patterns seen here. It takes more than 1,000 years for the varnish to accumulate to the width of a human hair. Much about the formation of desert varnish is still a mystery--it is not fully understood why varnish forms in some conditions and not others. These walls make good canvases for petroglyphs because of the contrast between the dark varnish with the underlying red sandstone.

Potholes are formed by water erosion, and mark places in the sandstone where the sediment is loosely cemented, often times because the sediment has been eaten away by microbes. Water typically seeps through sandstone, but when it gathers in pools it is because the water is held in place by a biofilm of cyanobacteria, fungi, algae, and fine sediment. These ephemeral potholes in turn house diverse microecosystems which ancient and often endemic species rely upon for survival as they are free of fish and aquatic insect predators, and are often called "Mesozoic lifeboat niches”  Pothole animals have not evolved in hundreds of millions of years.

## Cyanobacteria 

The stagnant waters of Lake Powell have created optimal conditions for cyanobacteria colonies to breed, staining the lake pea-green and posing serious health risks to animals and humans. Bacteria can become airborne as the water is disturbed. When ingested, cyanobacteria can cause respiratory paralysis, blistering, numbness, burning, incoherent speech, kidney failure, liver failure, vomiting, and death. Sediment provides a habitat for these bacteria to lie dormant over winter and seed future blooms. 

## Cryptobiotic 

living soils. The crusts hold soils in place during windstorms and hold moisture by up to 14% (Podmore 140). Dust landing on snowfields can decrease runoff by as much as 5%. (Podmore 140). Could help the toxic dust from blowing. (Podmore 141). 

## Fish

prior to 1973, state and federal governments stocked non-native sport fish and intentionally rmoved humbpack jub, boytail chub, razorback zuckers, flannelmouth suckers, Colorado pikeminnows calling them "trash fish." They also dumped 20,000 gallons fo rotenone to exterminate fish into the Green River. Native fish live longer because they must be patient to the river's fluctuations (Podmore 142). 

Humans are transporting pikeminnows and razorbacks in buckets up Fatt Falls, a waterfall that formed because of sedimenation. But the waterfall separates them from invasive predators. (Podmore 145)
## Beavers
slow the water, allowing plants to root

## Plants

At first, invasive species like tumbleweed, cheatgrass, and camelthorn take root. But after a few years, native species come back. Fremont fcottonwood, coyote willow, Goodding's willow, Indian paintbrush, hackberry, Western redbuds, singleleaf ash, miadenhair fern, columbine

"This is the most intact native ecosystem I've ever seen!" (Podmore 25) - biologist
## Antelope

Antelope cannot cross river anymore

## Birds

I saw a great blue heron, coots diving in a smelly cove. 

## Other life

Also bighorn sheep, deer, lizards, snakes, frogs, mountain lioins, ringtail cats, coytotes, black bears. Many drowned. Side canyons could support up to 200 species of birds. 

Wooly Mammoths used to live in Glen Canyon, according to dung found in Bechan Cave. There are petroglyph carvings of mammoths as well.

Much of Navajo Sandstone has "churned by insects and trampled by reptiles" (Loope and Rowe 2003, p. 223). Evidence of stromatalites has also been found, which are laminated growth structures created by microbes.
