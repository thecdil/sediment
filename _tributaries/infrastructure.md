Sediment both forms the concrete of the dam itself and the strata which it in place. But its accretion behind the dam reveals the project’s consequences, showing the ways these projects accumulate and hoard resources in some places, burying and subsuming the lives that came before while withholding it from others. 

The foundations of the Glen Canyon Dam were laid in the Colorado River's old bed. The river's water first had to be rerouted through temporary diversion tunnels, which took three years to dig. The diversion tunnels finished behind schedule as the soft sandstone continuously broke apart and collapsed into the tunnels. In 1958, for example, 5,200 cubic yards, or 500 dump trucks worth of sediment cleaved away in the left diversion tunnel. Much of the sand and rock used in Glen Canyon's concrete walls comes from Wahweep Canyon, which is a nearby tributary just five miles away from the dam site. 

When projects like the Glen Canyon Dam drown a landscape, they physically and figuratively subsume the histories encoded in that landscape. The inscription of other histories and forms of life and agency– the long and ancient geologic forces that formed the land, the river and wind and rain’s  work in composing the canyons and landforms, the microbes that bred desert varnish upon which Indigenous people etched out their stories in petroglyphs,  the landforms that allowed early Conquistadors to cross the river, the markings left by failed mining operations, the spoils of those operations, even the dry and muddy landscape that inspired such projects–all become illegible beneath the glossy reservoir, which instead asserts a scene of colonial control, stagnancy, riches, and violent, potent power. This breeds new inscriptions of a feral and pre-collapse–the proliferation of algae, mud glaciers, pollution, all of which are traces of both colonial impact on the land and work like tentacles to lay further claim on it. As the reservoir dries up and sediment continues to accumulate, these histories and inscriptions are resurfacing.

Sediment caches the gold, silver, and uranium deposits which drew early prospectors. It also stymied those same prospectors as it clogged and wore down mining machinery and chewed up and dispersed its minerals into fragments too small to be economically extractible. 

Miners picked steps into Glen Canyon's soft sandstone walls in order to more easily access gold deposits. The history of mining in Glen Canyon begins with James Merrick and Ernst Mitchell, who searched the nearby Navajo Mountain and Monument Valley region in the 1870s for the source of silver that supplied Navajo jewelry-makers. In 1879, the men were killed by members of the Southern Paiute tribe. Two buttes nearby, which were sacred to the Paitues, now bear their names. This event attracted attention to the region, especially from Cass Hite, who set out to search for the Merrick-Mitchell mine. With the help of a Navajo chief named Hoskinnini, Hite discovered placer gold near Dandy Crossing in 1883. Hundreds of miners rushed in, searching for gold at Wright sand bar. Hite sought investment and infrastructure to support gold mining in the canyon, prompting railroad construction by the Denver, Colorado, Canyon, and Pacific Railroad Co. Robert B. Stanton sought to build a railroad from Grand Junction to Gulf of California and staked out five placer claims in doing so, including near the mouth of Hanson (Pine Alcove) creek. He named his mining company the Hoskannini Mining Co., established in 1897 in Glen Canyon, which became the largest gold mining outfit in Glen Canyon. He became the second person to float from Green River through Glen Canyon while performing a railraod survey. By 1899, Stanton had 145 claims in glen Canyon, and bought a fleet of dredges in order to sift for gold dust in Glen Canyon's sand. He began dredge operations in 1901, but was stymied by variable water levels and his equipment's failure to capture gold dust. The silt-laden river water ate away at pump machinery and supply points were difficult due to the canyoned terrain. The project was abandoned. In 1909-1912, Charles H. Spencer and his American Placer Corp. prospected Lee's Ferry by sluicing, which was assisted by a pneumatic pipe which helped dredge sand and gravel for gold extraction, and processed the gold with amalgamation, which involves mixing mercury to separate ore from gold. This process took place near the Paria River. The machinery was powered from coal, which was mined from Warren Creek, and transported at first by mule train, and then by steamboat, which did not last long as there was not enough coal to power the steam boat. Spencer ran into issues with the price of mercury, which was higher than the price of gold extraction, and his mine shut down. In the 1920s, oil prospecting and drilling took place, and in the 1950s uranium claims were staked up and down Glen Canyon. The deposits were too low to be profitable and so most prospects went undeveloped.
