Glen Canyon is a land is made of sediment, deposited by ancient oceans, rivers, and winds. The Colorado River carries a heavy sediment load, and its silt-sharp waters enable the river to etch canyons, bridges, buttes, spires, and pedestal rocks out of the land. The water always delivers more sediment, laying down sandbars, rippled laminae, pocked muck, sink holes, silt volcanoes, and desiccated mud over the sandstone ground. 

Vertical space is disorienting; it is a disorienting landscape to navigate. I always thought I'd reach Lake's edge only to see a cliff. 

The walls feel and look like flesh; I wonder if that is why people are so drawn to this place; it feels alive. The earth seems to play with itself here. 

Land and water are in a complex relationship here; they define one another's edges and mingle.

## Formations

Soft sandstone often develop hollows across its face called tafoni. These caverns are scooped out by weathering processes such as water, wind, and chemical reactions, revealing where sediment particulates were bound together less firmly.

Geologist Herbert E. Gregory surveyed the land beginning in 1908 for the USGS, and is responsible for naming much of the strata. Gregory named layers Navajo Sandstone, Entrada (conquistadors), Bluff and Cow Springs (mormon settlements), Yale Point (alma mater). "Gregory, like Powell, affixed his interpretation of the stages of civilization onto the landscape, effectively placing Navajos beneath European and white civilization...the whites...named the features of the land according to a social and stratigraphical order that they themselves helped create. The emerging names of landforms and rock layers represented a narrative of racial hierarchies and stadial evolution theory....In this sense, knowledge production and shifting power relations were interconnected processes. As whites came to dominate in the region, a narrative retelling of the imposition of racial hierarchies and colonization efforts was literally mapped onto the landscape itself" (Bsumek 85-86).

"Water, warfare, and personal desire became features of the colonized landscape, and the names attached to each place serve as inscriptions that represent different stages--past, present, and imagined white future--of regional development." (Talking about Chinle, Carson Mesa, and Edna Needle).” (Bsumek 56)

"Many Navajos consider specific rock formations, including Tsé Naní' áhígíí 'actual incarnate forms of Navajo gods.'  Native peoples from the Navajo Mountain area...claim that 'geological formations in the Rainbow Bridge area...held positions of central importance in the religion of Navajo peoples,' and various tribal groups had constructed shrines in the vicinity of the bridge for centuries...Tsé Naní' áhígíí is linked  to Navajo origin stories...Navajo Holy Beings placed the magic rainbow in the safest place they could imagine...it was a place of refuge, where many Navajos fleeing Kit Carson's violent campaign to destroy their homelands between 1863 and 1864 hid.”  (Bsumek 68)

Navajo mountain is a warrior's shield (Podmore 183). 

Rainbow Bridge is the joining of two rainbow people, male and female, who gave birth to Rainbow and Cloud and made the land moist. Lamar Bedonie told Luckert that Rainbow Bridge "is not holy anymore, and so we do not have rain now...the Rainbow is broken. Our way of life, our way of thinking, our relgion is broken." (197)

 Vernon Masayesva on place: "It is our umbilical chord that connects us to our motherland" Vernon Masayesva, interview by Jack Loeffler, in Moving Waters: The Colorado
River and the West, program 1, six-part radio series, produced by Jack Loeffler for the
Arizona Humanities Council, 2001

" One-Eyed Man of the Salt Clan appears to be the Navajo
elder identified as Blind Salt Clansman, the first Diné credited with the “discovery” of
Rainbow Bridge. A petroglyph once commemorated Blind Salt Clansman’s journey to
the foot of the rainbow. Local resident Lamar Bedonie remembered, “Against the rock [Rainbow Bridge] Blind Salt Clansman was sitting on his horse. . . . in this manner Blind
Salt Clansman and his horse’s figures were engraved on the face of the rock—with him
sitting on his horse. That is gone now. Someone destroyed it.” (Luckert 146). 

Rainbow Bridge has long been understood as a place of refuge and source of water--in one story, two women carried water from a spring to their hogan, in another two men buried a shell with atlantic ocean water by rainbow bridge. (Dickey 25) The rainbow is a mode of transportation for mythical beings. It is also a protective shield for Navajo Mountain, head of earth woman. 

For the Hopi, the bridge represents the place that Tiyo, a hero for the Snake Clan, who trained to raft the Colorado River, ran and leapt across the Bridge. They also describe Spider Old Woman and brothers 
"Pokunghoya and Polonghoya as the deities responsible for
earthly and cosmological exploits. Pokunghoya and Polonghoya, for example, threw
lightning bolts and piled mud in huge heaps, slashing the earth’s surface and sculpting the
environmental wonders of the Colorado Plateau as they played nahoydadatsia...hrough their playful adventures, the brothers dictated
the course of the Colorado River through Glen and Grand canyons and formed the
mountains, mesas, buttes and spires, and numerous canyons that sever the high desert
landscape." (Dickey 42-43). 

Navajo mountain has 200 hopi dwellings (43)

"An adequate conception of the ruggedness of this particular region cannot be conveyed in words," wrote Earl Morris during his 1921 expedition into Forbidding Canyon. Morris had joined Charles L. Bernheimer's expedition to find an easier route between the main stem of the Colorado River and Rainbow Bridge, a natural arch which has captivated and drawn humans to it for millenia and is sacred for many Indigenous groups including the Navajo, Hopi, San Juan Southern Paiute, Kaibab Paiute, and White Mesa Ute. The group found little hope that Forbidding Canyon would make for an easier journey as it formed "a maze of tortuous canons winding in and out among dumpling-like knobs of rock, too hopelessly rough to be crossed" according to Morris. Eventually the group returned with dynamite to blast obstacles from their path. This trail became known as the Bernheimer trail. Forbidding Canyon flooded deep with water after Glen Canyon Dam was built, and it has now become the most visited tributary of Glen Canyon as 200,000-300,000 tourists motor boat through it to visit Rainbow Bridge.

Between 2000 and 2021, over one hundred thousand acres of land has reemerged. (Podmore 17)

Dominy formation, which can reach two hundred feet high, quickly getting flushed out, but once the Dominy formation reaches the back of the dam, it will break the dam, according to James Powell (Podmore 37). 

changing landscape, maps are usless "it directed us to campsites fifty vertical feet above the river." (Podmore 9) Podmore describes going around blind corners, not knowing what he would encounter. Podmore says it is an "active geologic force" which changes the river's course. Mike DeHoff says that the river cut down 33 vertical feet in two years" (209)

Verticality: Seth Arnes, ecologist, says that as you move up Lake Powell, "we're not only walking in space, we're also walking back in time." (126)

Each layer of the sediment laminae was laid by a distinct geologic event--such as a spring flood which deposited a load of sediment all at once. The ripples forms are carved by water, and keep a record of the river's current. Ripples form as water erodes sediment on the upstream (stoss) side of a bank and quickly deposit it on the downstream (lee) side.  These scallop-shaped structures are called catenary ripples, which suggest a faster flow. Today there is no current in the bottom reaches of Cottonwood Canyon as it lies below Lake Powell.
