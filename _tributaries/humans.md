# Humans

{% include feature/image-gallery.html objectid="sediment44" caption=false%}

Indigenous groups have lived in and around Glen Canyon for over 9,000 years. Sediment has provided material for the dwelling structures, pottery, irrigation canals, petroglyphs, and spiritual landmarks that support and orient the lives of the region’s many Indigenous communities. The canyons, bridges, buttes, and spires sediment carved out of itself–aided by wind and water–became important landmarks for many tribes’ cultural and spiritual formations. Despite the coerced removal of Indigenous people from the land, these sedimentary landmarks persist as markings of Indigenous territory. Nine federally recognized tribes have ties to Glen Canyon, including the Anasazi, Núu-agha-tʉvʉ-pʉ̱ (Ute), Diné Bikéyah (Navajo), Hopitutskwa (Hopi), Nuwuvi (Southern Paiute), A:shiwi (Zuni), and Havasu Baaja (Havasupai). 

### Dwelling

Ancestral Puebloans built thousands of dwelling structures up and down the Canyon and its tributaries. These dwellings were typically constructed with stone fragments held together by adobe, composed of sediment, straw, and water. Dwellings were often nestled in the canyon's natural topographical features such as alcoves or mesa tops.

Petroglyphs adorn much of the canyon, marking places where culturally or personally important events have unfolded, and inscribing various Indigenous communities’ presence, territory, and ways of life onto the landscape itself. The contrast in color between the glyph and the surrounding stone is created by desert varnish, which forms when sediment interacts with air, water, minerals, and microorganisms over thousands of years. A petroglyph requires both the absence and presence of sediment: one must carve out some sediment and release it into the land. This process entrusts the human story to the land, and it binds humans, language, and sediment together and locks it in the landscape. This is markedly different than a paper medium, which can be transported across locations, which does not return material to the land, and which does not locate the human story in the geologic record. 

"We can see evidence of how Utes used the landscape to record their history and culture on the area's sandstone walls. The archaeologist Polly Schaafsma asserts, 'Rock art is the product of shared concepts and modes of picturing the world held by members of any given culture at any particular time and in a particular place. With or without intent, a corpus of mutually understandable iconography distributed throughout a given landscape is a mechanism for asserting identity in space...such images illustrate that Utes chronicled their kills, kept an eye on animal populations, used horses and dogs in their hunts, and made their mark on the landscape as they etched their activities onto the canyon walls in their homeland."
