SCRAWLED ACROSS GLEN Canyon's rock faces are the tracks and tracings of human life. Some of these markings are inadvertent, the scars left behind as people moved through and settled in the Canyon. Chinked steps, gouged footholds, dynamite-blasted trails reveal where Paiute hunters, Diné sheepherders, Spanish Conquistadors, Mormon pioneers, and uranium miners sought access to--or passageway through--the canyon's enclaves. Dugout caves, adobe dwellings, stone granaries, irrigation canals, and the borings of loom holes locate where Puebloan weavers, Hopi Farmers,and gold prospectors made their homes. 

Other markings are intentional, as if those humans who engraved petroglyph tapestries and carved out their names wanted to ensure their existence was remembered by the people of the future. 

All of these tracings, inadvertent or intentional, assert a claim on Glen Canyon. 

Each trail, etching, and boring indicates the presence of a human who felt that the land was theirs to alter, that the rocks and mud were theirs for home-building, that the canyons were theirs to blow open, or that the sandstone was theirs to inscribe. 

For political ecologist Laura Ogden, such processes, in which an actor--human or not--reworks the elements of the earth in order to profess or make possible their belonging are forms of *territorial inscription*. 

"Birds claim territory through song;" she writes, "fiddler crabs dig burrows; ocean life glows with bioluminescence; beavers build lodges and dams. The suburbs are a nested architecture of inscription practices, from gated entrances to backyard privacy fences. These practices of territorial inscription leave their mark on the world, though sometimes the mark is just a shimmer" [^1]. 

Glen Canyon's inscriptions, then, trace out a kind of territorial map, overlapping with various and often contested claims. 

This map is not flat, and its territories do not sit cleanly beside one another (as few territories do). This is a vertical and lively cartography; more like a palimpsest in which various inscriptions layer and touch, transform and efface one another through time. This is a map whose material recirculates and is reused to build new life: the concrete of dams, the adobe grouting of homes, or the bedding of microbes.

## Subsumation

{% include feature/image-gallery.html objectid="sediment123" caption=false%}

WHEN THE GLEN Canyon Dam was completed in 1963, the United States declared--in the dam's 700-foot tall concrete walls and in the reservoir it sent spreading over 250 square miles of land--that the Canyon and its flooded tributaries were theirs. As Lake Powell bloated higher and swelled further than the river had ever reached, its waters engulfed thousands of Indigenous petroglyphs, dwellings, and trails, drowned out the microbial films which once draped the Canyon's walls, the habitats and shallow prints of herons, frogs, and lizards, and the swaths of coyote willow, paintbrush, columbines, and cottonwoods that once grew along the riverbanks. Lake Powell covered, too, the tracks of colonial forebears, swallowing the physical residues of mining operations, the etchings made by the canyon's first white explorers, and homesteads of early settlers. And it hid the once volatile river beneath its glossy surface. 

Together, the dam and the lake visually and symbolically insist upon complete colonial territorialization, and they serve to erase the archive of the lives that came before, removing any physical evidence of a different past, of other claims to the land. This total subsumation props up western notions of linear progress and unidirectional time, and it reifies the belief that the present can be laid over the past like the next layer of strata. 

{% include feature/image-gallery.html objectid="sediment37" caption=false%}

Yet, as sediment reminds me, neither the earth nor history are quite so stratigraphic. Instead, particulates of the past are constantly eroding and resurfacing into the present and the future. In Glen Canyon, reemergence and recirculation are not metaphors. Glen Canyon's inscriptions cut through time, bringing people of different temporalities into contact and interaction with one another.

## Absence and Presence

{% include feature/image-gallery.html objectid="sediment80" caption=false%}

SOMEONE GATHERS UP rust-colored rocks and heaps them into a shallow stone bowl. With another, stronger stone, they pulverize the rust-colored rocks into dust and stir in water or their own spit, or animal fat or blood, until the dust becomes a red and gluey paste. They dip each of their hands in the paste and press them splayed against a sandstone wall. Their companions follow suit, leaving ten pairs of dark handprints reaching up Glen Canyon's sides. 


<div class="float-start pe-4 mb-2 w-50" >

{% include feature/image-gallery.html objectid="sediment163" caption=false%}

</div>

<br>

Long after the people move on, their handprints remain, registering their existence and this moment of contact with Glen Canyon, this blending of stone and water, spit, or animal. As other people from different times and places pass by the wall, some place their own hands over the prints, as Tad Nichols does here. For a moment, the people of the past and the present draw together, sharing the same gesture in the same place. 

Handprints like these are sometimes called dermatoglyphs, which Laura Ogden translates to mean "traces of existence." They carry, she writes, "the past and being-in-the world forcibly into the present. In doing so, they touch us" [^2]. 

Something is communicated in this touching: a recognition of presence and precedent, perhaps. "We were here, just as you are now" the handprints say. But there is something ghostly about the prints too; the absence of other bodies feels conspicuous--almost tangible--in the empty space around Tad. 

For Jacques Derrida, traces are inherently spectral in that they disclose the "absence of presence" by drawing attention to what was once there, but is no longer.[^3] 

It strikes me, though, that a different kind of absence is present here. When I think of absence, I think of nonexistence, nonparticipation, a complete lack of being in and bearing on the moment. Yet the handprints preserve a lingering presence and carry their makers into an ongoing participation in the world which exceeds their physical absence. As Tad touches the prints, they touch him too, altering his interactions with the canyon. 

But just as the past informs and transforms the unfoldings of the present, so can the present distort the traces of the past. Tad lifts flecks of paint from the prints in his touching, and wipes away, forever, a bit of the past. If this gesture is repeated enough times, handprints will be erased, and this wall will no longer communicate to visitors about the people who came before. 

Material traces connect people across otherwise disconnected segments of time, and draw us into conversation and relation with one another. It matters how we encounter and touch these traces. [continue]

## Foundations

{% include feature/image-gallery.html objectid="sediment164" caption=false%}


ONE DAY AFTER the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad, ten men disembarked from a Union Pacific Train at Green River Station, Wyoming. They had with them four wooden boats, packed with compasses, thermometers, barometers, chronometers, guns, ammunition, as well as coffee, flour, bacon, and beans, paid for by the U.S. Army. Thirteen days later, on May 24th, 1869, the men and their boats pushed off from the banks of the Green River and headed downstream towards the Colorado. They would paddle nearly one thousand miles over the course of the next three months, lose one of their boats and a third of their food, and three of the men would die. 

Their leader was John Wesley Powell, a one-armed Civil war Veteran, geologist, ethnographer, and botanist, and their purpose was to survey the length of the Colorado River. They assessed the land's potential for settlement and agriculture, and they filled in what had been considered a "blank spot" on the map of the United States with data on the basin's topography, climate, botanical makeup, water resources, and Indigenous cultures. 

The maps and reports that Powell produced significantly altered the course of western development. Powell identified that survival in the West was more contingent on access to water (which was scarce) than land (which was plenty); a direct inversion of the conditions that governed settlement in the East. Eastern settlers were land hungry, but had taken water for granted, and until Powell's expeditions, expansionists had not considered that in order to move westward, they would either have to reconfigure their lifestyles--or reconfigure the land. 

{% include feature/image-gallery.html objectid="sediment191" caption=false%}


Powell cautioned Congress in 1890 that life would have to mold itself around the West's sparse waterways, and he drew up a map which proposed state lines follow watershed boundaries. Each state, then, would organize public irrigation infrastructure in order to provide water distribution for agrarian communities. At first, Powell's heedings were wholly rejected; lawmakers, like many Americans believed that as emigrants surged westward that "rain would follow the plow." But by 1902, Congress had come to accept that agrarian settlements in the west would fail without large-scale water management interventions, just as Powell had advised. Thus, the Bureau of Reclamation was born. Over the next hundred years, they would go on to construct more than 600 dams, including the Hoover Dam, the Grand Coulee Dam, and the Glen Canyon Dam, drastically transfiguring the landscapes and waterflows of the West. 

But before these projects could begin, or even be imagined, the American West had to first be carefully mapped, its water tallied, and its topography plotted. Land managers, engineers, and lawmakers needed to understand the contours of the land and the precise location of its resources in order to lay out plans to settle it. 

Thus, the first step to developing the West was to plumb the landscape for any evidence it offered towards its potential for extraction and development. Powell understood that such evidence  

Powell read the traces in the landscape in order to chart a future for colonization. Both remnants of people, water, and plants mattered. 

Powell saw geology and ethnography both as data for colonization. 

Traces like these figured critically into how proceeding humans interacted with and reshaped Glen Canyon. John Wesley Powell, who famously led a government-sponsored survey of the Colorado River in 1869 in order to determine the potential for colonization and resource extraction of the region, often recorded close detail of traces of both Indigenous presence and absence. This was more than a personal interest. As historian Erika Marie Bsumek notes, "Throughout his journey, [Powell] also looked to the surrounding landscape for clues to help him understand how people had once lived in the area and what had happened to them."  In other words, Glen Canyon's tracings became evidence of 

...to determine the region's future, white scientists determined they needed to gain a fuller understanding of the previous generations' relationships with the...desert landscapes...white interlopers...believed that Indigenous cultures belonged to the past, not the present.” (64, 66-67)

## Remains of the Future

IN DECEMBER 2025, I drove from my home in the Idaho panhandle down to Glen Canyon. This is a seventeen hour trip, so I stopped halfway for a few nights, in a small town along the western hem of the Tetons. I was hoping to cross country ski, but I arrived to find the valley bare and dry--which given the weeks-long string of sunny, 55 degree days wasn't so much surprising as disconcerting. 

FIX: In the west, bad winters mean bad summers; rampant fires, smoke-choked skies, and half-empty reservoirs. Western Americans are closely attuned to these cross-seasonal contingencies . People I spoke with from Idaho to Arizona were anxiously monitoring the weather of the present in order to predict the climates of the future. Time and space in the west is linked 


I drove up the upper reaches of the foothills were crusted with only a thin and scratchy layer of snow. I skied once, clattering over chundered trails, and then searched the internet for other things to do. 

This was how I learned about the Teton Dam. FIX

In November of 1975, the Bureau of Reclamation completed a 305-foot tall, half-mile long earthen dam along the Teton River, despite the alarm of their own engineers and geologists. The canyon which would buttress the dam was riddled with fissures and composed of porous rock--basalt and rhyolite. The region was known to experience regular seismic activity. But the Bureau, emboldened by their decades-long streak of building improbable dams simply caulked the rifts with grout and proceeded as usual. 

The reservoir reached full pool seven months later--and immediately collapsed. 80 billion gallons of water moving at 2 million cubic feet per second surged out from the reservoir, chewing open the dam walls to rip across the plain in a flood 15 feet high and four miles across. Two towns were wiped off the banks. Eleven people and 16,000 livestock drowned. 

Fifty years later, the landscape still bears the scars of the catastrophe, and the remnants of the failed dam. 

The morning I went to the dam, a record-breaking was blowing across the Pacific Northwest. I drove thirty miles east out of Driggs, fighting to keep my car straight against gusts that reached eighty miles per hour. There is a small brown sign on the side of the highway, pointing down a broken road. I eased over potholes and heaves. In some sections, dirt had crawled out onto the pavement, covering it entirely. The road ends abruptly at the edge of the canyon, and is taped across by orange construction flagging. 

I sat in my car for a moment, which was rocking in the heavy wind. Perhaps it was the apocalyptic weather--the grey yellow skies and the tumbleweeds shooting across the plains--or the signs posted all around that told me I was being surveilled, or the thick rusted pipe at the edge of the parking lot that looked as if it had been hurled up by the flood, or perhaps it was the knowing that I was in a place that fifty years before had been the site of cataclysmic disaster, but I began to feel a deep dread. Eventually I pushed my door open--it was caught by the wind and flung back and I had to fight to close it again. I started down a rutted dirt trail towards the remains of the dam. 

The wind howled a low tone. It began to rain, and I nearly turned back, but the wind was pushing me forward and I went. Eventually, over a crest, the dam came into view. What remained was a stark and ugly cone with its face cut cleanly off, rising up from the canyon floor. Up on either hillside stood disconnected concrete abutments, both of which were scrawled with graffiti and circled by a chainlink fence that had been bent back in places where people had climbed through. I hurriedly took pictures, too frantic at this point to notice that some of my pictures were obscured by the fence wires. I turned down valley, and saw the path of the flood--a scoured chasm stretched out into the distance, walls bared and torn and crumbling in.

A gust of wind whipped down the plains, this time bringing rain sideways, and the fence began to rattle. The dread

Indigenous groups have lived in and around Glen Canyon for over 10,000 years. Sediment has provided material for the dwelling structures, pottery, irrigation canals, petroglyphs, and spiritual landmarks that support and orient the lives of the region’s many Indigenous communities. The canyons, bridges, buttes, and spires sediment carved out of itself–aided by wind and water–became important landmarks for many tribes’ cultural and spiritual formations. Despite the coerced removal of Indigenous people from the land, these sedimentary landmarks persist as markings of Indigenous territory. Nine federally recognized tribes have ties to Glen Canyon, including the Anasazi, Núu-agha-tʉvʉ-pʉ̱ (Ute), Diné Bikéyah (Navajo), Hopitutskwa (Hopi), Nuwuvi (Southern Paiute), A:shiwi (Zuni), and Havasu Baaja (Havasupai).

Corn and beans are deeply rooted in Hopi origin mythology. They are a people who came from water, made a circle and wound off again. Sand would blow in and cover fields--Hopi would wait until it moved on (Courlander 134)

"How would America feel if we decided to flood Arlington Cemetery and the Tomb of the Unknown Solder" -Hank Stevens, resident of Navajo Mountain and Navajo Nation's representative on the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition. (Podmore 157).

Erasure: Eliot Porter's book "None but Indians have ever lived in this country, and they exist as only a part of it, they pass through it silently, leaving as little trace as sunlight through wind." (Podmore 32)

A dwelling documented by Powell called Fort Moki was drowned, then reexposed. But the Dominy formation changed the river's course "like a hose under high pressure" and it collapsed. (Podmore 33)

The land swap was preceded by violence on McCracken Mesa, in which many horses were killed or sold back to Navajo for high prices. They sued and were awareded $100,000 in damages which never arrived. The Navajos supported Glen Canyon under the auspices that they would benefit from the CRSP via the Navajo Indian Irrigation pProject, which was never finished (Podmore 193). 

Hopi stories talk about a hero who floated from Colorado River to the Gulf of California, where he learned the rain dance (197). Navajo say the joining of the San Juan and Colorado created water chihldren, cloud and rain people." (Podmore 197).

{% include feature/image-gallery.html objectid="sediment137;sediment116" caption=false%}

Ancestral Puebloans built thousands of dwelling structures up and down the Canyon and its tributaries. These dwellings were typically constructed with stone fragments held together by adobe, composed of sediment, straw, and water. Dwellings were often nestled in the canyon's natural topographical features such as alcoves or mesa tops.

Petroglyphs adorn much of the canyon, marking places where culturally or personally important events have unfolded, and inscribing various Indigenous communities’ presence, territory, and ways of life onto the landscape itself. The contrast in color between the glyph and the surrounding stone is created by desert varnish, which forms when sediment interacts with air, water, minerals, and microorganisms over thousands of years. A petroglyph requires both the absence and presence of sediment: one must carve out some sediment and release it into the land. This process entrusts the human story to the land, and it binds humans, language, and sediment together and locks it in the landscape. This is markedly different than a paper medium, which can be transported across locations, which does not return material to the land, and which does not locate the human story in the geologic record. 

"We can see evidence of how Utes used the landscape to record their history and culture on the area's sandstone walls. The archaeologist Polly Schaafsma asserts, 'Rock art is the product of shared concepts and modes of picturing the world held by members of any given culture at any particular time and in a particular place. With or without intent, a corpus of mutually understandable iconography distributed throughout a given landscape is a mechanism for asserting identity in space...such images illustrate that Utes chronicled their kills, kept an eye on animal populations, used horses and dogs in their hunts, and made their mark on the landscape as they etched their activities onto the canyon walls in their homeland."

In 1776, Franciscan priests, Fathers Escalante and Dominguez set out from Santa Fe, New Mexico in search of an overland route to a Catholic Mission in Monterrey, California, but they were forced to backtrack as winter approached. Indigenous guides had initially led them safely across the Colorado, but on their return their guide, who was 12 years old, suddenly quit after witnessing the severe punishment of a servant. Lost and out of supplies, the party was forced to eat their horses. They wandered along the Colorado River for a month before they found an accessible crossing. The exact location of this crossing is unknown, but the Fathers remarked in their journal that the crossing was made possible by carving steps down the sandstone cliffs, and by swimming across a part of the river that had been made narrow by sandbars trapped by a bend in the river. The Crossing of the Fathers now lies beneath Lake Powell's waters.

"An adequate conception of the ruggedness of this particular region cannot be conveyed in words," wrote Earl Morris during his 1921 expedition into Forbidding Canyon. Morris had joined Charles L. Bernheimer's expedition to find an easier route between the main stem of the Colorado River and Rainbow Bridge, a natural arch which has captivated and drawn humans for millenia, and is sacred for many Indigenous groups including the Navajo, Hopi, San Juan Southern Paiute, Kaibab Paiute, and White Mesa Ute. The group found little hope that Forbidding Canyon would make for an easier journey as it formed "a maze of tortuous canons winding in and out among dumpling-like knobs of rock, too hopelessly rough to be crossed" according to Morris. Eventually the group returned with dynamite to blast obstacles from their path. This trail became known as the Bernheimer trail. Forbidding Canyon flooded deep with water after Glen Canyon Dam was built, and it has now become the most visited tributary of Glen Canyon as 200,000-300,000 tourists motor boat through it to visit Rainbow Bridge. 

"Bryon Cummings, an archaeologist and professor of Greek and Latin at the University of Utah, and William Douglass, the general land surveyor for the USGS...set out to find [Rainbow Bridge] in 1909...It became a significant episode in the use of science in the name of preservation as a form of regional development. The discourse of discovery was often a precursor to the invention of a place in the historical imagination. Douglass wanted the region to remain 'wild' and 'undeveloped'...Cumming's desire to claim the bridge was fueled by his academic ambition." (Bsumek 68-69). 

Eugene C. LeRue, hydraulic engineer was hired in 1921 by USGS and the Southern California Edison power company to survey, map, and explore the Colorado and Green Rivers. He looked for sites for a hydroelectric dam and storage reservoir. He studied the Navajo Twins or Hero Twins or Monster Slayer rocks in order to understand erosion rates, "an issue that would become increasingly important as engineers contemplated building a dam along the Navajo sandstone walls at Glen Canyon." However, these rocks represent sacred figures in Navajo cosmology who helped fight the monsters "who were creating problems to bring balance to the world." (Bsumek 96)

"On May 10, 1910, President William Howard Taft signed a proclamation designating the 160 acres surrounding the bridge as Rainbow Bridge National Monument...the official proclamation stated: "the extraordinary natural bridge, having an arch which is in form and appearance much like a rainbow...is of great scientific interest as an example of eccentric stream erosion....It appears that the public interest would be promoted by reserving this bridge as a National Monument."

## Reclamation

When John Wesley Powell surveyed and mapped Glen Canyon in 1869, he read the canyon's petroglyphs and Indigenous dwellings both as important evidence of human presence and absence, both which spurred the project of colonizing the region.

In 2019, the reservoir genearted $420 million. 

In 1990s, the gas station at Dnagling Rope Marina was the the biggest marina fuel stop east of the Mississippi. The Earth Island Institute concluded in 1997 that the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez amount of fuel leaked into Lake Powell every 3.8 years (Podmore 74). 

An early supporter of the Reclamation Act said in 1905 that "the object of the Relcmation Act is not so much to irrigate the land as it is to make homes." (Podmore 79)

Powell said that Indigenous people were a "vital resource to be mined and transformed into knowledge." (132)

Podmore describes cans and plastic fused to the rock and carvings from tourists (149).

 As sediment was carried by water and and wind, it etched webs of canyons and laid down sandy troughs over the plateau, carving a rough terrain out of itself. Early Mormon outcasts, seeking a remote place to settle, found the rugged land attractive, though difficult to navigate. As they traveled, they dynamited holes and axed trails into the land, and affixed those sites into their mythology as the site Mormon origin into the West. 

{% include feature/image-gallery.html objectid="sediment61" caption=false%}

This same terrain, made of both hard-packed and loose sediment did not absorb rainfall like the soils of the east, but instead quickly diverted water into deep, hard-to-reach canyons. The rest of the plateau often remained dry and thus resisted sedentary agriculture practices. The Mormons called dusty landscape barren, and ordained themselves by God to make “the desert blossom like a rose,” (Isaiah 35:1), kicking off a reclamation/infrastructure mania that still grips and shapes life and land in the river basin today. 

The Mormons did not invent irrigation in Glen Canyon, and they often built their own canals on top of the irrigation ditches already excavated by Indigenous communities. In other words, the success of Mormon settlements was dependent on reading the archive left in the canyon, which mapped out its fertile spaces. This also serves to erase the evidence of Indigenous agriculture and existence.

 Mormons reused the materials of Indigenous dwellings to build their own. This shows me the ways that the physical landscape is reconstructed to serve as an archive for the dominant culture.

As they traveled, they dynamited holes and axed trails into the land, and affixed those sites into their mythology as the site Mormon origin into the West.

This same terrain, made of both hard-packed and loose sediment did not absorb rainfall like the soils of the east, but instead quickly diverted water into deep, hard-to-reach canyons. The rest of the plateau often remained dry and thus resisted sedentary agriculture practices. The Mormons called dusty landscape barren, and ordained themselves by God to make “the desert blossom like a rose,” (Isaiah 35:1), kicking off a reclamation/infrastructure mania that still grips and shapes life and land in the river basin today. 

The Mormons did not invent irrigation in Glen Canyon, and they often built their own canals on top of the irrigation ditches already excavated by Indigenous communities. In other words, the success of Mormon settlements was dependent on reading the archive left in the canyon, which mapped out its fertile spaces. This also serves to erase the evidence of Indigenous agriculture and existence.

 Mormons reused the materials of Indigenous dwellings to build their own. This shows me the ways that the physical landscape is reconstructed to serve as an archive for the dominant culture.

Sediment both forms the concrete of the dam itself and the strata which it in place. But its accretion behind the dam reveals the project’s consequences, showing the ways these projects accumulate and hoard resources in some places, burying and subsuming the lives that came before while withholding it from others. 

The foundations of the Glen Canyon Dam were laid in the Colorado River's old bed. The river's water first had to be rerouted through temporary diversion tunnels, which took three years to dig. The diversion tunnels finished behind schedule as the soft sandstone continuously broke apart and collapsed into the tunnels. In 1958, for example, 5,200 cubic yards, or 500 dump trucks worth of sediment cleaved away in the left diversion tunnel. Much of the sand and rock used in Glen Canyon's concrete walls comes from Wahweep Canyon, which is a nearby tributary just five miles away from the dam site. 

When projects like the Glen Canyon Dam drown a landscape, they physically and figuratively subsume the histories encoded in that landscape. The inscription of other histories and forms of life and agency– the long and ancient geologic forces that formed the land, the river and wind and rain’s  work in composing the canyons and landforms, the microbes that bred desert varnish upon which Indigenous people etched out their stories in petroglyphs,  the landforms that allowed early Conquistadors to cross the river, the markings left by failed mining operations, the spoils of those operations, even the dry and muddy landscape that inspired such projects–all become illegible beneath the glossy reservoir, which instead asserts a scene of colonial control, stagnancy, riches, and violent, potent power. This breeds new inscriptions of a feral and pre-collapse–the proliferation of algae, mud glaciers, pollution, all of which are traces of both colonial impact on the land and work like tentacles to lay further claim on it. As the reservoir dries up and sediment continues to accumulate, these histories and inscriptions are resurfacing.

Sediment caches the gold, silver, and uranium deposits which drew early prospectors. It also stymied those same prospectors as it clogged and wore down mining machinery and chewed up and dispersed its minerals into fragments too small to be economically extractible. 

Miners picked steps into Glen Canyon's soft sandstone walls in order to more easily access gold deposits. The history of mining in Glen Canyon begins with James Merrick and Ernst Mitchell, who searched the nearby Navajo Mountain and Monument Valley region in the 1870s for the source of silver that supplied Navajo jewelry-makers. In 1879, the men were killed by members of the Southern Paiute tribe. Two buttes nearby, which were sacred to the Paitues, now bear their names. This event attracted attention to the region, especially from Cass Hite, who set out to search for the Merrick-Mitchell mine. With the help of a Navajo chief named Hoskinnini, Hite discovered placer gold near Dandy Crossing in 1883. Hundreds of miners rushed in, searching for gold at Wright sand bar. Hite sought investment and infrastructure to support gold mining in the canyon, prompting railroad construction by the Denver, Colorado, Canyon, and Pacific Railroad Co. Robert B. Stanton sought to build a railroad from Grand Junction to Gulf of California and staked out five placer claims in doing so, including near the mouth of Hanson (Pine Alcove) creek. He named his mining company the Hoskannini Mining Co., established in 1897 in Glen Canyon, which became the largest gold mining outfit in Glen Canyon. He became the second person to float from Green River through Glen Canyon while performing a railraod survey. By 1899, Stanton had 145 claims in glen Canyon, and bought a fleet of dredges in order to sift for gold dust in Glen Canyon's sand. He began dredge operations in 1901, but was stymied by variable water levels and his equipment's failure to capture gold dust. The silt-laden river water ate away at pump machinery and supply points were difficult due to the canyoned terrain. The project was abandoned. In 1909-1912, Charles H. Spencer and his American Placer Corp. prospected Lee's Ferry by sluicing, which was assisted by a pneumatic pipe which helped dredge sand and gravel for gold extraction, and processed the gold with amalgamation, which involves mixing mercury to separate ore from gold. This process took place near the Paria River. The machinery was powered from coal, which was mined from Warren Creek, and transported at first by mule train, and then by steamboat, which did not last long as there was not enough coal to power the steam boat. Spencer ran into issues with the price of mercury, which was higher than the price of gold extraction, and his mine shut down. In the 1920s, oil prospecting and drilling took place, and in the 1950s uranium claims were staked up and down Glen Canyon. The deposits were too low to be profitable and so most prospects went undeveloped.
