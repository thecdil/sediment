ABOVE GLEN CANYON'S rim, the land swells with domed mounds of rock. Their sides are deeply lacerated, but their edges are soft, and swoop gently. To me, it looks as if scoops of ice cream have been dropped over the plateau, or as if a baker has patiently laminated slim rounds of cake and left them to droop under the hot sun. Some of the mounds evoke the mud castles children make at the beach by dribbling wet sand, and they reminisce of withered dunes fixed in place—which in fact, they are.   

<br>
<br>

190 million years ago, during the Early Jurassic period, wind systems blew vast quantities of sand over the western continent. The sand piled into a sea of high dunes, and the winds whipped the dunes higher and steeper until the sand at the peaks met their angle of repose and tumbled down in thin avalanches to spill over the leeward slopes. Each avalanche spread a fresh coating of sand over the dunes’ shoulders, and these coatings stacked up like the layers of a cake. Later, under the weight of ensuing sand, the laminations were cemented in place, aided by cloying minerals. 

<br>
<br>

When I look at these photos, I am struck by the memories that the land holds, and the way it bares these memories so plainly. It does not take a geologist to see what has happened here: when I showed these photographs to a poet friend and asked him to describe what he saw, he said he saw the wind. If I look long enough, I start to believe that I can feel those old winds, see the dunes spill over themselves, hear the swish of sand, although I am separated from all of this not only a thousand miles but also by 200 million years. The dunes no longer shift, but I can clearly sense their motion. I think about the stretching millenea, the torrent of events through which these thin remainders of wind have stood, and I feel as if time has compressed, as if the past has risen up, as if the land is impressing a story of its ancient self--its lively motion, its patient world-making--on all who care to look. 

<br>
<br>

Geologists have helped me to translate a more detailed story about the sand's origins. By reading the slope of the rock's striations—which they call crossbeds—geologists can determine that in the era of the dunes, the prevailing winds blew in from the north-north west. And by looking closely at individual sand grains, geologists have also found that the particles are round in shape, evidence of a long and wearing journey, and are made from fine quartz and zircon, which discloses their origin: the Appalachian mountains of the east. Together, the sand's shape and mineral identities have helped geologists to reconstruct a story that connects Glen Canyon to places and systems far away and long since gone: they say that an ancient river once flowed from Appalachia across the continent and deposited debris at its northwestern mouth, from where the wind carried the debris southwest to form a sandsea. 

<br>
<br>

I cannot see the shape of the sand grains, nor discern its mineral makeup. But by reading geologic histories, I have come to understand that material can carry an imprint of its origins and communicate the tracings of its movements. Scholars who study narrative say that a narrative occurs when "somebody tells someone else on some occasion that something happened." When sand grains reveal to geologists their continental crossings and encounters with distant rivers, when they lay down in such a way that they tell my friend about the wind, I wonder: is this a narrative?

## Grains of Sand

{% include feature/image-gallery.html objectid="sediment38" width="75" caption=false%} 


AS I COME across closer pictures of sandstone, I begin to see the texture of its grain, and I think about the multitude of histories collected in Glen Canyon's old dunes. If sand and rock tell a story, it is one that is swirled with other places and actors, strung with webs of countless and iterated interactions between distant mountains and rivers, brought together by the wind. This narrative structure is unfamiliar to me: it does not line up with the narratives I know, in which a singular character (who is almost always human) marches through time, self-individuating as they brush against actors and places outside of themselves. By the time I reach the end of most stories, each character has become contained, made distinct against their settings, separated from others through their interactions. But the more I try to hone in on the story of a single grain, the more I get flung out across wider and wider reaches of space, and the less I am able to pinpoint where the agency behind this story lies: with sand, with river, or with wind?

<br>
LIKE MY POET friend, when I look at photographs of Glen Canyon's sandstone hills, I find it easy to see the trackings of the wind. But in my eye is also drawn to the caverns pocked into the hills' folds, markings I find more difficult to decipher. Yet I recognize them. I had seen caverns just like these smattering the walls of Labyrinth Canyon--a few hundred miles upriver from Glen Canyon--while on a canoe trip with a friend one August. For five days, we paddled by thousands of honeycombed hollows and wondered what they were. Unable to consult the internet, we reverted to our childhood imaginations and told each other stories about fairy cities that had been dug out of the cliff faces with tiny fairy hands and rock-blasting magic. They lived there, we said, to hide from the desert sun, wind, rain, and also from us, which explained why we hadn't seen any. 

<br>
<br>

We were wrong, of course, but our instincts that the caverns marked traces of invisible life turned out to be right. Microbial communities proliferate in sandstone, eating holes out of the rock as they metabolize sediment. This work is not performed alone, however: microbes might etch a only small indentation in the rock before rain and wind take over, scooping the hollows deeper, allowing small pools of water to collect. In these pools, microbes flourish, devour more sediment, and burrow deeper. 

<br>
<br>

The wind, I have learned, works with many collaborators to shape Glen Canyon.

## Layers

{% include feature/image-gallery.html objectid="sediment139" width="75" caption=false%}


GLEN CANYON'S PETRIFIED sandsea-which geologists call Navajo Sandstone-composes only a single layer of the canyon's strata. Many others lay above and below, each formed during a different geologic epoch. In these eras, sediment was delivered by sea, by river, by glacier, and again, by wind.

<div class="col-lg-7">
I SPENT THE summer of 2025 in Northern Arizona University's digital collections, clicking through photographs of Glen Canyon from my desk in Idaho. I was in the early stages of my thesis work, and I had become intrigued by the idea that sediment was an under-narrated character in Glen Canyon's history, a kind of unseen agential force in the ecosystem. I had found this agency difficult to represent in writing alone, and decided I would need photographs

 I submitted a proposal to the University of Idaho's Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CDIL) hoping they could help me present a multimedia narrative of sediment in a digital format. As I moved along my research, however, I found that sediment's agency was inextricably wrapped up in a variety of others; I could not talk about sediment without talking about its associations with wind, water, animals, and humans. 

<br>
<br>

I also began to question whether it was responsible, or even correct to portray sediment as the primary agency in Glen Canyon's ecosystem. Wasn't this the same narrow approach taken by the dominant, human-centered histories I was attempting to counter? Didn't these histories also make the case that the canyon was ruled by one actor while sidelining others? Had I just swapped one main character for another, when in fact, as sediment and its interactions had repeatedly showed me, Glen Canyon's history is co-written by the ensemble of its sediment, wind, water, animal, and humans? 

<br>
<br>

When I began my summer fellowship with the CDIL, they explained to me that their platform was designed to exhibit archival collections, and they trained me on archival research methods. I first looked for photographs that demonstrated the sedimentary agency was I trying to convey, but I began to realize that I was looking at an archive within an archive. In nearly every photograph, sediment seemed to be imprinted with a multitude of histories, crossed with the tracks and tracings of water, wind, animals, and people.  

<br>
<br>

I shifted my focus. I started to approach the archive with the question: what can sediment tell me about the history of Glen Canyon? Most photographs of Glen Canyon feature sediment in some formation, of course; the terrain is composed almost entirely by sedimentary strata, rock fragments, and sandy beaches. I decided then to pause on photographs in which I sensed there might be some kind of underlying story that would help me explain what I was seeing, and then tracked down these stories by searching books, geologic reports, and written histories.

## Wonder 
<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-6">

WHEN I FOUND photograph number 25, a rock in the vague shape of an animal walking over the plateau, I did not want to uncover any explanation that would rationalize how sediment came to take this life-like form. I wanted to believe for an irrational moment that this rock exhibited something verging on mythical animacy. I wanted to remain in wonder. 

<br>
<br>

Instead, I search the photograph's title, "Balanced Rocks," and find that balanced rocks are formed as when the wind plucks loose sand off the ground and blasts it against a boulder, eating away the rock's lower layers until all that is left is a narrow pedestal. The formation of balanced rocks also depends on what kinds of material compose each part of the rock: quartz particles stick closely together and are more resistant to erosion, while sandstone made of feldspar and clay is loose, and falls easily away.

<br>
<br>

Even after I learn how balanced rocks get formed, I cannot get past a feeling of wonder. I wonder at the cooperation between wind and sand, their joint ability to sculpt such lively forms. I wonder too that even in its absence, in spaces where it has blown away, sediment divulges stories about itself and its world.

<div class="col-lg-4">

IN THE COLLECTION, I find more photographs of balanced rocks, and in all of them, the photographer, Tad Nichols, has placed the rocks at the center of the photograph, as if he is taking their portraits, as if he is trying to capture something essential about them. I sense wonder in the composition of these photographs. Perhaps my wonder is not only mine, but also Tad's.

<br>
<br>

Tad spent many years of his life in Glen Canyon, weaving in and out of its nooks by boat and by foot. He took over 3,800 photos, many of which were later gathered in a book called *Glen Canyon: Images of a Lost World*, published in remembrance of the pre-dammed canyon. Most of the pictures I save are his.

<div class="col-lg-7">

ON HIS TRIPS, Tad was frequently accompanied by his friends Frank Wright and Katie Lee, who documented the travels of "We Three" in her journal, which she published under the title *All My Rivers Are Gone.* Katie's journals are ebullient with wonder.

{% include feature/blockquote.html quote="*For reasons unexplained, we spoke in whispers as we walked beside a stream that seemed to flow stronger and gurgle louder than it had in times past. We waded between high sloping banks of maidenhair furn that had turned to bright turquoise--they bobbed under a seep and shivered in a light breeze. We skirted gentle sluices, stooping to feel them run through our fingers, awed by the patient force of moving water that ultimately wins. Dilation darkened our eyes, amazement heightened our whispers. As our intimacy with the the canyon grew, all we said and did threaded past in slow motion. For once, I was lagging behind, wrapped in a timeless aura--not at all certain that I hadn't been standing right there two thousand, ten thousand years ago. The thought must have occurred to us all at the same time--that we were passing through a subterranean fairlyland in a sparkling blue sea--but only Tad voiced it--'feels like we're walking under water'--before he realized he shouldn't have. I lost it completely; went to my knees crying hysterically, screaming obscenities at the politicians and bureaucracies that had orchestrated the drowning of Eden.*" size="sm"  source="Katie Lee, *All My Rivers are Gone*, pp. 165-166." link="sedminent12"%}

When I read Katie's journals, I cannot help but feel tangible wonder for a landscape I will never see. Katie also writes sharply of loss, and I feel loss too, not only as I read her open grief for the canyon, but as I move through the archive knowing much of what I see is now gone.

<br>
<br>

Currents of loss seem to run through Tad's photographs as well. On the same trip that he took the balanced rock pictures, Tad noted in his journal that workers had already descended on the canyon, marking out the site of the future dam. Knowing that the canyon would soon be submerged beneath Lake Powell, was Tad driven to capture Glen Canyon's wonder, or its impending loss? In his balanced rock pictures, wonder and loss seem to twine.

<br>
<br>

In her book *Loss and Wonder at the World's End*, Laura Ogden posits that loss and wonder commonly emerge as dual refrains in places touched by colonization and environmental change. Ogden thinks of loss not only as absence, but inundation. “These days," she writes, "loss doesn’t seem like a dry empty desert. Instead, loss is soggy, a terrain of wet clothes and sodden dry wall” (5). But the tides of loss, she notes, spread unevenly, taking on different shapes and intensities as loss flows through the various bodies that populate a lost terrain. My sense of loss is not the same as Tad's or Katie's, and their loss is not the same as that of the canyon's native species or people, who, when flood came, lost their home and means of living. "Losses," she continues, "are rarely equally distributed" (7). The atmosphere of loss which hovers around Glen Canyon takes on many forms, taking on different tints and contours as it touches each of the canyon's subjects. 

<br>
<br>

For Ogden, wonder does not lie outside of loss. Oftentimes, wonder instigates loss. Pointing to the word's entanglement with *Wunder-kammer* "those “curiosity cabinets” flled with skulls, artifacts, rocks, fossils, and other specimens" she defines wonder as the "impulse to know and acquire the world" (7). I think here about the title of Katie's book, which uses the possessive 'my' when referring to the river, and I think about the common use of the words 'capture' and 'take' in reference to photography. In this light, Tad's photograph collection becomes a kind of *Wunder-kammer,* a curiosity cabinet filled with the rocks and artifacts of Glen Canyon. Katie and Tad did not want to take the canyon all for themselves, but they did want to maintain their access to it, an access that was predicated on the removal of Glen Canyon from Indigenous possession--oftentimes in the name of wonder.

In 1909, BYRON Cummings, an archaeologist at the University of Utah, and William Douglass, the general land surveyor for the USGS set out on a mission to find the rumored Rainbow Bridge, a large natural arch wedged in one of Glen Canyon's side canyons. Led by Paiute guides Jim Mike and a father and son both named Noscha Begay, they found it, and quickly disseminated papers declaring their "discovery," despite the contradiction that this discovery was only made possible by their guides' prior knowledge of the bridge. 

<br>
<br>
One year later, President William Howard Taft designated the Bridge and the 160 acres surround it a National Monument, writing, "[the] extraordinary natural bridge, having an arch which is in form and appearance much like a rainbow...[is] of great scientific interest as an example of eccentric stream erosion....[It] appears that the public interest would be promoted by reserving this bridge as a National Monument" (qtd. in Bsumek 72). Rainbow Bridge had long been a sacred site for the Puebloan, Navajo, Ute and Paiute peoples, and the land surrounding it their home. But as rhetorics of wonder and curiosity about the bridge began to circulate, these rhetorics quickly impelled the government to seize the land from Indigenous peoples. 

<br>
<br>
Wonder continued to uphold settler claims on Glen Canyon: in the 1930s, journalist John Stewart MacClary visited Rainbow Bridge, and subsequently published a magazine article in which he wrote: “all classes were entitled to the privilege of viewing the natural wonder, since Uncle Sam had reserved it as property for the people” (qtd. in Farmer 79). By this time, a robust tourist economy was beginning to collect around Glen Canyon, hinged on marketing the wonder of the landscape. Wonder had become a commodity.

## Aridity

{% include feature/image-gallery.html objectid="sediment61" width="75" caption=false%}

THE FEELING I remember most from my time on the Colorado Plateau is the crackling dryness that plucked at my skin, the film of dust that settled in my pores, in my the crevices of my bedding, in the fabric of my clothes. At night, the wind lifted up the rain fly of my tent, and in the morning, I would touch my face and find it slipped with fine grains. I spent most of my time outside, building trails for work, and had access to showers or sinks only when I returned to my aunt's house every eight days, where I would watch a muddy stream pour off my body and swirl down the bathtub drain. For most of my days in the field, I was within a few horizontal miles of the Colorado River, but it was tucked out of reach, 6,000 feet below me at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. Bathing would have required hiking 24 miles roundtrip from camp.  

Only once, in all those months, did I wash my dust off in the Colorado River. This was during a detour to Lee's Ferry, the only place in Arizona where the river's canyons dip and relent enough to allow access by road. I jumped in without hesitation, fully clothed, and rubbed the sand out from my ears and the webbing of my hands. Then I sat down on the beach to dry. By the time I got back in the car, I was dusty again. 

{% include feature/image-gallery.html objectid="sediment123" width="75"  caption=false%}

In the 19th century, the Mormons arrived to Colorado Plateau from the east, but they quickly found that the desert climate did not offer sufficient rain to nourish their farms, nor could they access the waters of the plateau's stashed rivers without either settling in the canyons, or without constantly moving between plateau and river. But both options would have limited their ability to impose unfettered agricultural expansion on the land and forced them to give up Euroamerican ideals of pastoral enclosure and settlement. Instead, Mormons looked at the dry, dusty, landscape, the deep rivers, and decided they had been ordained by God to make "the desert bloom like a rose." So began an irrigation mania set on drawing the Colorado River up out of its canyons to water Mormon homes and fields, and so began a cascade of reclamation projects which would radically restructure life and land across the Colorado Plateau.

For historian Erika Marie Bsumek, colonization is often built upon rhetorics that first cast the land as somehow impoverished--too dry, too dusty, too icy, too wild--and therefore in need of transformation. By imagining the aridity of the Colorado Plateau as a problem in need of a solution, Mormon settlers justified their encroachment on land that had been occupied by--and supported--Indigenous communities for thousands of years. Bsumek notes, as does Jen Rose Smith, that settler logics are quick to extend judgments about inadequate landscapes to make racialized demarcations about the land's native inhabitants, both of which serve the same aim: to legitimize the dispossession of Indigenous nations in the name of settler expansion. This logic was made overt in the 1930s, when the United States government declared that erosion along the Colorado River corridor was threatening to silt up to their newly-built Hoover Dam. Although the Colorado River has carried a heavy silt load for millions of years, the government blamed Navajo sheepherders, and mandated the slaughter of half a million Navajo sheep. The Livestock Reduction Act decimated Navajo livelihoods, and it paved the way for the coercive treaties that would transfer Navajo lands into the hands of the United States. On some of this land, the government built the Glen Canyon Dam. 




### Toxic Air
{% include feature/image-gallery.html objectid="sediment77" caption=false%}

AS WITH THE rest of the globe, a new climate has arrived in Glen Canyon. Temperatures are rising, water supply is falling, demand for water is growing, and Lake Powell is drying up. Data published by the Bureau of Reclamation shows a steady decline in the lake's water levels beginning in the year 2000, when the lake was nearly full. As of October 2025, the lake is at 27.62% of its total capacity, and many worry that if this trend continues, the lake could eventually disappear altogether. As the lake runs dry, a transformed landscape--and climate--is emerging. Where there was once canyon, river, or lake, there are now deep beds of silt which have been accumulating behind the dam for the last 60 years. And buried in those silt beds are the spoilages of Glen Canyon's industrial past, ready to resurface and spew across the basin. 

In 1949, in the wake of World War II and the rush for nuclear power, the Vanadium Corporation of America constructed a uranium mill on the banks of Glen Canyon. The mill closed in 1953, but Vanadium left behind 26,000 tons of radioactive tailings in an uncovered heap. When Lake Powell began to fill ten years later, dam managers decided to allow lake waters to back up over Vanadium's refuse, which leached into Lake Powell's sediment. If and when the lake retreats, this radium-infused sediment will become exposed to air and wind, and radioactive dust will blow across the basin. Uranium is bone-seeking, meaning once it gets into the body, it settles in the skeleton and incorporates with the bone's minerals. Cells decay when they come into contact with radium, causing the body to eventually disintegrate. Here, sediment becomes not only an archive of the past, but an archive of the future, laced with the deadly potentialities of distant wars and old economies which now threaten to enter and dissolve the bones of people in the future. Sediment becomes the point around which the currents of the past and the future, the planetary and the cellular converge. 

{% include feature/trib-button.html trib="infrastructure" image="mining" text="Mining" %}


{% include feature/image-gallery.html objectid="sediment155" caption=false%} 

Radium is not the only danger lurking in Lake Powell's sediment. The lake's silt beds have also become a breeding ground for anaerobic bacteria, which digest organic material cached in the sediment and turn this material into methane. Trapped beneath the pressure of the lake, methane will collect in pockets and fissures in the silt, but as the lake recedes and pressure is released, methane erupts to surface and dissipates into the atmosphere. Methane is 80 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide and reservoirs-- such as Lake Powell-- contribute 6%-8% of total human-caused methane emissions, according to John Harrison, a professor at Washington State University.  

At the same time as the global climate affects Lake Powell, Lake Powell affects the global climate. Scientists call this kind of cycle, in which change amplifies change amplifies change a positive feedback loop. Positive feedback loops draw their components together into an ever more chaotic and tightly bound spiral. I picture two hurricanes colliding, their arms locking, and turning each other like gears spun out of control until they merge into one superstorm, and I think about the echo between a microphone brought too close to a speaker, which gets faster and higher and faster and higher until the two echoes become one high screech. It's important to note that the currents between the components in a loop system move both ways--that is, Glen Canyon is not only a repository for the waves that arrive from the external world, but flings its own waves back out, across the basin and the planet. 

{% include feature/image-gallery.html objectid="sediment38" caption=false%} 

As I try to map Glen Canyon's past and future stories, pull together the threads of events that have moved through so many other places, drawn along by so many other actors across so many different times, I think back to the swirled layers of the petrified sandsea. If I am to tell a true story about Glen Canyon, I think it needs to look like this: it needs to be particular--made of a mass of granular stories-- and it needs to follow the vaster currents that carried them there. These stories need to heap, whirl, and mingle, and they must inevitably erode, recirculate, and transform as they are dragged out into other spaces and other times.
