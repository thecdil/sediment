# Colonization


### Conquistadors

In 1776, Franciscan priests, Fathers Escalante and Dominguez set out from Santa Fe, New Mexico in search of an overland route to the Catholic Mission in Monterrey, California, but they were forced to backtrack as winter approached. Indigenous guides had initially led them safely across the river, but on their return their guide, who was 12 years old, suddenly quit after witnessing the severe punishment of a servant. Lost and out of supplies, the party was forced to eat their horses. They wandered along the Colorado River for a month before they found an accessible crossing. The exact location of this crossing is unknown, but the Fathers remarked in their journal that the crossing was made possible by carving steps down the sandstone cliffs, and by swimming across a part of the river that had been made narrow by sand bars and the river's bend. The Crossing of the Fathers is now under Lake Powell's waters. 

### Exploration

{% include feature/image-gallery.html objectid="sediment17"%}

"An adequate conception of the ruggedness of this particular region cannot be conveyed in words," wrote Earl Morris during his 1921 expedition into Forbidding Canyon. Morris had joined Charles L. Bernheimer's expedition to find an easier route between the main stem of the Colorado River and Rainbow Bridge, a natural arch which has captivated and drawn humans for millenia, and is sacred for many Indigenous groups including the Navajo, Hopi, San Juan Southern Paiute, Kaibab Paiute, and White Mesa Ute. The group found little hope that Forbidding Canyon would make for an easier journey as it formed "a maze of tortuous canons winding in and out among dumpling-like knobs of rock, too hopelessly rough to be crossed" according to Morris. Eventually the group returned with dynamite to blast obstacles from their path. This trail became known as the Bernheimer trail. Forbidding Canyon flooded deep with water after Glen Canyon Dam was built, and it has now become the most visited tributary of Glen Canyon as 200,000-300,000 tourists motor boat through it to visit Rainbow Bridge. 

"Bryon Cummings, an archaeologist and professor of Greek and Latin at the University of Utah, and William Douglass, the general land surveyor for the USGS...[set] out to find [Rainbow Bridge] in 1909...It became a significant episode in the use of science in the name of preservation as a form of regional development. The discourse of discovery was often a precursor to the invention of a place in the historical imagination. Douglass wanted the region to remain 'wild' and 'undeveloped'...Cumming's desire to claim the bridge was fueled by his academic ambition." (Bsumek 68-69). 

Eugene C. LeRue, hydraulic engineer was hired in 1921 by USGS and the Southern California Edison power company to survey, map, and explore the Colorado and Green Rivers. He looked for sites for a hydroelectric dam and storage reservoir. He studied the Navajo Twins or Hero Twins or Monster Slayer rocks in order to understand erosion rates, "an issue that would become increasingly important as engineers contemplated building a dam along the Navajo sandstone walls at Glen Canyon." However, these rocks represent sacred figures in Navajo cosmology who helped fight the monsters "who were creating problems to bring balance to the world." (Bsumek 96)


"On May 10, 1910, President William Howard Taft signed a proclamation designating the 160 acres surrounding the bridge as Rainbow Bridge National Monument...the official proclamation stated "The extraordinary natural bridge, having an arch which is in form and appearance much like a rainbow...is of great scientific interest as an example of eccentric stream erosion....It appears that the public interest would be promoted by reserving this bridge as a National Monument." (Bsumek 72)

### Reclamation

John Wesley Powell, on his 1869 journey down the canyon, read the ruins, irrigation ditches, temporary dams and petroglyphs as evidence that "both past and present Native Americans were largely transient populations who moved according to changing environmental conditions," and thus concluded that "Indigenous cultures belonged to the past, not the present" (Bsumek 66-67). The impetus for reclaiming the land thus relies on the weaponization of an archive to interpret it as both potential and failure at the same time as it negates the realities of the ecosystem and the lifeways that emerged out of its conditions.


### Mormons

 As sediment was carried by water and and wind, it etched webs of canyons and laid down sandy troughs over the plateau, carving a rough terrain out of itself. Early Mormon outcasts, seeking a remote place to settle,found the rugged land attractive though they difficult to navigate. As they traveled, they dynamited holes and axed trails into the land, and affixed those sites into their mythology as the site Mormon origin into the West.

This same terrain, made of both hard-packed and loose sediment did not absorb rainfall like the soils of the east, but instead quickly diverted water into deep, hard-to-reach canyons. The rest of the plateau often remained dry and thus resisted sedentary agriculture practices. The Mormons called dusty landscape barren, and ordained themselves by God to make “the desert blossom like a rose,” (Isaiah 35:1), kicking off a reclamation/infrastructure mania that still grips and shapes life and land in the river basin today. 

The Mormons did not invent irrigation in Glen Canyon, and they often built their own canals on top of the irrigation ditches already excavated by Indigenous communities. In other words, the success of Mormon settlements was dependent on reading the archive left in the canyon, which mapped out its fertile spaces. This also serves to erase the evidence of Indigenous agriculture and existence.

The Mormons reused the materials of Indigenous dwellings, once again literally deconstructing the evidence of territory and remaking it. This shows me the ways that the physical landscape is reconstructed to serve as an archive for the dominant culture.
