# About Glen Canyon 

Glen Canyon (called Tséyi, or deep in the rock by Diné) sits just upstream from the Grand Canyon and straddles modern-day Arizona and Utah. Like the Grand Canyon, Glen Canyon formed around 6 million years ago as the silt-rich Colorado River downcut through 700 feet of the Colorado Plateau. Seven federally recognized Indigenous tribes have ancestral ties to Glen Canyon, including the Diné (Navajo), Hopi, Ute Mountain Ute, San Juan Southern Paiute, Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah, Kaibab Paiute, and Zuni. Glen Canyon is also home to 79 native plant species, 189 native bird species, 34 native mammal species, and 8 native fish species. 

Since 1966, Glen Canyon has lay beneath Lake Powell, a man-made reservoir held back by the 700-foot tall Glen Canyon Dam. The damming of Glen Canyon destroyed vast swaths of critical wildlife habitat, inundated countless culturally vital sites, displaced thousands of Indigenous families from their homelands, and dispossessed tribal nations of their land and water rights. As a result, the Glen Canyon Dam has long drawn public criticism, even outrage, for the harms it has incited.  "Surely," wrote Edward Abbey, "no manmade structure in history has been hated so much by so many, for so long with such good reason as Glen Canyon Dam."

Today, 

When the Glen Canyon Dam drowned Glen Canyon, it also subsumed the lives and histories inscribed in the canyon’s landscape. But these histories are not lost. As sediment and its unceasing erosions reminds us, the past is always resurfacing to shape the present.

*Sedimentation.*




Glen Canyon is a land made of sediment. Its sprawling canyon system was etched by the Colorado River’s silt-heavy waters, which downcut through 700 feet of sedimentary rock laid in place by ancient winds, rivers, and oceans. Traces of the canyon's past are written in the canyon's sediment: dinosaur fossils and bone dust are encased in the canyon walls; microbial communities eat potholes and varnish across cliff faces; herons stamp their tracks into riverside beaches; petroglyphs bear the markings of Indigenous life; dynamite-blasted chasms reveal the trails of Mormon settlers, and the canyon's silty beds are laced with the spoils of the mid-century Uranium boom. 

Yet if you were to travel to Glen Canyon today, you would not find a canyon. Nor would you find a red and silty river, or sandbars teeming with life. Most of the canyon's petroglyphs and trails lie beneath 600 feet of water, and its varnished walls are now chalked with salt.
