# Want to Take Action? 

Since John Wesley Powell's first trip down the Colorado River in 1869, the American Government has treated Glen Canyon like a resource free for the taking. But Glen Canyon is not a resource, nor was it ever free to take: Glen Canyon is a vibrant ecosystem, and it has nourished both Indigenous Nations and multispecies communities since time immemorial. 

Policies and infrastructures set upon extraction have unfortunately resulted in Glen Canyon's drowning and the displacement of countless people, plants, and animals from their ancestral land. 

Remediation means undoing policies that continue to treat the land like a resource, and it means doing everything possible to right and repair past harm. 

If you'd like to contribute to these efforts, you can:

## Support Utah Diné Bikéyah
Utah Diné Bikéyah means "the people’s sacred lands” in Navajo. This nonprofit supports the Navajo, Hopi, Zuni, Ute Mountain Ute, and Uintah Ouray Ute Tribes to protect and heal their ancestral lands.

## Donate to DigDeep by the Navajo Water Project

Although Lake Powell is on ancestral Navajo Land, 30% of Navajo Nation families live without running water. The Navajo Water Project is an Indigenous-led organization on a mission to get clean, running water to more Navajo homes. Consider donating to support their work.

# Want to Learn More?

*Sedimentation* is deeply inspired by the many historians, geographers, political ecologists, journalists, activists, and river-lovers who have thought deeply about Glen Canyon or other sites of human-nature interaction. 

Below are the works that I have found to be the most exciting, enlightening, and moving.

If you'd like to learn more about Glen Canyon's history, human-nature relations, or spatial storytelling, I hope you'll find this is a good place to start.

### *Floating Coast: An Environmental History of the Bering Strait*, by Bathsheba Demuth
Synopsis excerpt: The unforgiving territories along the Bering Strait had long been home to humans—the Iñupiat and Yupik in Alaska, and the Yupik and Chukchi in Russia—before American and European colonization. Rapidly, these frigid lands and waters became the site of an ongoing experiment: How, under conditions of extreme scarcity, would modern ideologies of capitalism and communism control and manage the resources they craved?

### *Life After Deadpool: Lake Powell's Last Days and the Rebirth of the Colorado River*, by Zak Podmore
Synopsis excerpt: A changing climate and design flaws in the Glen Canyon Dam have pushed the once-massive Lake Powell reservoir to the brink of collapse. Now, as Glen Canyon reemerges, its surprising ecological rebirth reminds us that nature’s capacity to heal may well outpace our own imaginations. Environmental journalist Zak Podmore explores the complex challenges ahead and reframes the inevitable loss of Lake Powell as a turning point for a more sustainable future.

### *Dead Pool: Lake Powell, Global Warming, and the Future of Water in the West*, by James Lawrence Powell
Synopsis excerpt: *Dead Pool* explains why America built the dam that made Lake Powell and others like it and then allowed its citizens to become dependent on their benefits, which were always temporary. Writing for a wide audience, Powell shows us exactly why an urgent threat during the first half of the twenty-first century will come not from the rising of the seas but from the falling of the reservoirs.

### "Colonial Becoming: An Unfolding Story of the Colorado River," by Andrew Curley

Abstract excerpt: This paper argues that the Colorado River is a story of ‘colonial becoming,’ the making of a ‘resource’ for purposes of diversion, irrigation, and ultimately dispossession. The paper works first to show how settler-colonialists defined ‘the river,’ then linked it to projects of empire informed by a colonial ontology that saw the desert as bereft of life and needing improvement.

Abstract excerpt: This article accounts for the colonial politics necessary to bring Colorado River water into Phoenix and Tucson. It highlights how the following moments worked to enlarge Arizona’s population and power while denying Diné water claims: the 1922 Colorado Compact, Arizona’s 1960s campaign for the Central Arizona Project, and recent Indian water settlements between Arizona and Navajo Nation.
