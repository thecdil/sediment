*Sedimentation* was deeply influenced by the brilliant work of historians, geographers, political ecologists, journalists, activists, and river lovers who have written about Glen Canyon and/or other sites of human-nature interaction. Below are the works that I have found to be the most exciting, inspiring, and moving.

If you'd like to learn more about Glen Canyon's history, think more human-nature relations, or explore spatial storytelling, this is a good place to start.

Ogden brings together animals, people, and things—from beavers, stolen photographs, lichen, American explorers, and birdsong—to catalog the ways environmental change and colonial history are entangled in the Fuegian Archipelago of southernmost Chile and Argentina.

### *Floating Coast: An Environmental History of the Bering Strait*, by Bathsheba Demuth

 Synopsis excerpt: The unforgiving territories along the Bering Strait had long been home to humans—the Iñupiat and Yupik in Alaska, and the Yupik and Chukchi in Russia—before American and European colonization. Rapidly, these frigid lands and waters became the site of an ongoing experiment: How, under conditions of extreme scarcity, would modern ideologies of capitalism and communism control and manage the resources they craved?

### *Underflows: Queer Trans Ecologies and River Justice*, by Cleo Wolfe Hazard

### *Life After Deadpool: Lake Powell's Last Days and the Rebirth of the Colorado River*, by Zak Podmore*

Synopsis excerpt: A changing climate and design flaws in the Glen Canyon Dam have pushed the once-massive Lake Powell reservoir to the brink of collapse. Now, as Glen Canyon reemerges, its surprising ecological rebirth reminds us that nature’s capacity to heal may well outpace our own imaginations. Environmental journalist Zak Podmore explores the complex challenges ahead and reframes the inevitable loss of Lake Powell as a turning point for a more sustainable future.

### *Dead Pool: Lake Powell, Global Warming, and the Future of Water in the West*, by James Lawrence Powell

 Synopsis excerpt: *Dead Pool* explains why America built the dam that made Lake Powell and others like it and then allowed its citizens to become dependent on their benefits, which were always temporary. Writing for a wide audience, Powell shows us exactly why an urgent threat during the first half of the twenty-first century will come not from the rising of the seas but from the falling of the reservoirs.

### *Glen Canyon Dammed: Inventing Lake Powell and the Canyon Country*, by Jared Farmer

 Synopsis excerpt: Jared Farmer traces the history of exploration and development in the Four Corners region, discusses the role of tourism in changing the face of the West, and shows how the "invention" of Lake Powell has served multiple needs.

### *All My Rivers are Gone: A Journey of Discovery Through Glen Canyon*, by Katie Lee

### Andrew Curley has written a number of spectacular books and articles on Navajo Nation and the Colorado River

* #### *Carbon Sovereignty: Coal, Development, and Energy Transition in the Navajo Nation*
Synopsis excerpt: Geographer Andrew Curley, a member of the Navajo Nation, examines the history of coal development within the Navajo Nation, including why some Diné supported coal and the consequences of doing so.

* #### "Colonial Becoming: An Unfolding Story of the Colorado River"

Abstract excerpt: This paper argues that the Colorado River is a story of ‘colonial becoming,’ the making of a ‘resource’ for purposes of diversion, irrigation, and ultimately dispossession. The paper works first to show how settler-colonialists defined ‘the river,’ then linked it to projects of empire informed by a colonial ontology that saw the desert as bereft of life and needing improvement.

* #### "Infrastructures as colonial beachheads: The Central Arizona Project and the taking of Navajo resources"

Abstract excerpt: This article accounts for the colonial politics necessary to bring Colorado River water into Phoenix and Tucson. It highlights how the following moments worked to enlarge Arizona’s population and power while denying Diné water claims: the 1922 Colorado Compact, Arizona’s 1960s campaign for the Central Arizona Project, and recent Indian water settlements between Arizona and Navajo Nation.
