## Beginning

Embedded in Glen Canyon's sandstone walls and sandy shorelines is a vibrant archive of stories. Fossilized tracks, ephemeral footprints, and microbial burrows trace the flourishings and diminishments of the canyon's biotic life. Wind-cut furrows, river-carved chasms, and elaborately swirled rock formations recount ancient interplays between water, wind, and land. Petroglyph tapestries, gouged trails, dynamite-blasted mining scars, and a seven-hundred foot tall concrete dam catalog varied and sometimes conflictory relationships between humans and the natural world. Together, these earthly records reveal how Glen Canyon’s various agents have interacted with the landscape, and with each other. 

*Sedimentation* is a collection of these stories, excavated from Glen Canyon's sedimentary archive.
