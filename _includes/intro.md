## Beginning

Embedded in Glen Canyon's sandstone walls and muddy shorelines is a vibrant archive of stories. Fossilized tracks, ephemeral footprints, and microbial burrows trace the rhythms and pulses of the canyon's biotic life. Wind-cut furrows and river-carved chasms recount ancient interplays between water, wind, and land. Petroglyph tapestries, mining scars, and a seven-hundred-foot-tall concrete dam catalog diverse and sometimes conflictory relationships between humans and the natural world. Together, these sedimented records reveal how Glen Canyon’s various agents have interacted with the landscape--and with each other, often across seemingly disjointed times and spaces. 

*Sedimentation* is a collection of these stories, excavated from Glen Canyon's sedimentary archive.
