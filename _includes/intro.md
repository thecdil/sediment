## Beginning


Sedimentation is an exploration of Glen Canyon’s tangled human and ecological histories, traced through the sedimentary archive. Like sediment itself, this project excavates and collects fragments of stories, histories, visualizations, and data from the strata of human and nonhuman experiences, and interlaces them through a multitude of spatial representations, visualizations, and narrative. Also like sediment, this work is tangled, fractaled, interlinked, and never complete. Navigating through this space may be disorienting, circular, and overwhelming at times–but then again, so is sediment.
