## Beginning

*Devin, I am thinking that rather than describe where Glen Canyon is, we can include a map? Thoughts?*

Glen Canyon is a land made of sediment. Its sprawling canyon system was etched by the Colorado River’s silt-heavy waters, which downcut through 700 feet of sedimentary rock laid in place by ancient winds, rivers, and oceans. Traces of the canyon's past are written in the canyon's sediment: dinosaur fossils and bone dust are encased in the canyon walls; microbial communities eat potholes and varnish across cliff faces; herons stamp their tracks into riverside beaches; petroglyphs bear the markings of Indigenous life; dynamite-blasted chasms reveal the trails of Mormon settlers, and the canyon's silty beds are laced with the spoils of the mid-century Uranium boom. 

Yet if you were to travel to Glen Canyon today, you would not find a canyon. Nor would you find a red and silty river, or sandbars teeming with life. Most of the canyon's petroglyphs and trails lie beneath 600 feet of water, and its varnished walls are now chalked with salt. 

When the Glen Canyon Dam drowned Glen Canyon beneath Lake Powell in 1963, it also subsumed the lives and histories inscribed in the canyon’s landscape. But these histories are not lost. As sediment and its unceasing erosions reminds us, the past is always resurfacing to shape the present.

*Sedimentation* is an exploration of Glen Canyon's tangled human and ecological histories, traced through the sedimentary archive. Like sediment itself, this project excavates and collects fragments of stories, histories, visualizations, and data from the strata of human and nonhuman experiences, and interlaces them through a multitude of spatial representations, visualizations, and narrative. Also like sediment, this work is tangled, fractaled, interlinked, and never complete. Navigating through this space may be disorienting, circular, and overwhelming at times--but then again, so is sediment.
