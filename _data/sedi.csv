The history of mining in Glen Canyon begins with James Merrick and Ernst Mitchell, who searched the nearby Navajo Mountain and Monument Valley region in the 1870s for the source of silver that supplied Navajo jewelry-makers. In 1879, the men were killed by members of the Southern Paiute tribe. Two buttes nearby, which were sacred the Paitues, now bear their names. This event attracted attention to the region, especially from Cass Hite, who set out to search for the Merrick-Mitchell mine. With the help of a Navajo chief named Hoskinnini, Hite discovered placer gold near Dandy Crossing in 1883. Hundreds of miners rushed in, searching for gold at Wright sand bar. Hite sought investment and infrastructure to support gold mining in the canyon, prompting railroad construction by the Denver, Colorado, Canyon, and Pacificic Railroad Co. Robert B. Stanton sought to build a railroad from Grand Junction to Gulf of California and staked out five placer claims in doing so, including near the mouth of Hanson (Pine Alcove) creek. He named his mining company the Hoskannini Mining Co., establisehd in 1897 in Glen Canyon, which became the largest gold mining outfit in Glen Canyon. He became the second person to float from Green River through Glen Canyon while performing a railraod survey. By 1899, Stanton had 145 claims in glen Canyon, and bought a fleet of dredges in order to sift for gold dust in Glen Canyon's sand. He began dredge operations in 1901, but was stymied by variable water levels and his equipment's failure to capture gold dust. The silt-laden river water ate away at pump machinery and supply points were difficult due to the canyoned terrain. The project was abandoned. In 1909-1912, Charles H. Spencer and his American Placer Corp. prospected Lee's Ferry by sluicing, which was assisted by a pneumatic pipe which helped dredge sand and gravel for gold extraction, and processed the gold with almagamation, which involves mixing mecury to separate ore from gold. This process took place near the Paria River. The machinery was powered from coal, which was mined from Warren Creek, and transported at first by mule train, and then by steamboat, which did not last long as there was not enough coal to power the steam boat. Spencer ran into issues with the price of mercury, which was higher than the price of gold extraction, and his mine shut down. In the 1920s, oil prospecting and drilling took place, and in the 1950s uranium claims were staked up and down Glen Canyon. The deposits were too low to be profitable and so most prospects went undeveloped.
